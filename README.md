#DMGe
DMGe - A GameBoy emulator and debugger. 

##Current State
Currently it is not 100% functional. We have several opcodes implemented and the basis of a GUI, however both the BIOS and game ROM filenames are hardcoded for test purposes.

There is no graphical output or sound currently.

##Building
Building (as of now) is a *relatively* painless task on both Linux and Windows.

###Prerequisites
DMGe must be built against Boost and wxWidgets. The most recent releases of both will work absolutely fine, although this is subject to change.

###The Build Process
The easiest way to build DMGe is to simply load it up in Code::Blocks, make sure all of the paths are correct and build.
